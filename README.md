# India in Pixels Expressions Study
The objective of this study was to recreate [this visualization](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/word-sentiment-scale/) in an Indian context.

## Collating Labels
On 23rd July 2021, I asked followers of India in Pixels [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1426757271032552&id=772316443143308) to mention all possible replies
to the question - *What do you think about this?* in Hindi. As I saw people started reporting answers in their languages, I expanded the scope of the project to include any Indian language.

Based on all the responses, on 20th November 2021, I compiled a final list of finalist expressions from 4 languages - Hindi, Bengali, Malayalam and Tamil based on the number of responses received and the spectrum of expression across which the words spanned.

## Collecting ratings
A simple Firebase powered interface was created here: [Expressions Survey](https://indiainpixels.github.io/expressions) where people could rate each word based on their own positivity score. There are some expletives in the dataset which people could keep out of their questionnaire, if they chose to do so.

## Dataset
After 72 hours, the survey was closed (still available but the database has read and write disabled now) The raw data was downloaded as `responses.json` and the legend of word - language mapping is attached in `lang_source.json`
